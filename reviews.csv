We did not start off smoothly as my husband spilled his water on the table and we couldn't find anyone to assist with cleaning it up.  But it got better as the night went on.  

Prior to going I had looked at the menu and gotten some food suggestions.  I ordered the mango lassi to drink due to reviews and it was delicious.  For appetizer we got the golgappa and chicken lollipops.  Really liked the green sauce with the  golgappa.  Chicken lollipops were delicious as well.  I wanted to try a dosa so the waiter suggested the truffle masala dosa and it was delicious.  My parents are from Pakistan and it reminded me of something my mom makes.  I was super full by this point but had to order the butter chicken.  I got it extra spicy and it was delicious.  Husband got the lamb chops and they were delicious as well.  We ended up taking home a lot of leftovers, but they were soo good reheated.  

The restaurant itself is a little funky when you first walk in.  The place to wait is pretty tiny.  The restaurant itself is spacious with lots of tables and a large bar. 

I will def go again and try some more food!",29-Jul-25,"Saint Louis, MO",Mishell H.,5

The menu has sooo many options and lots of vegan/vegetarian choices too which is amazing. They had some different options than just the basics I usually get from most Indian places so we ordered quite a few things. Everything came out pretty fast and was super flavorful and delicious. The presentation was so pretty too and seemed like all the food and drinks had care and time put into it. Our server was great as well (Umesh) he was really attentive and provided great service through the whole dining experience. Definitely a hidden gem and will be returning!,28-Aug-25,"St. Louis, MO",Sophia L.,5

Love the chill music vibes and atmosphere inside. Even though it was a Thursday night, the restaurant was quite busy (which is always a good sign!). We had a reservation and the service was pretty fast.

- Pineapple Mojito: 8/10 on the sweeter side, but not too sweet or strong
- Chicken Lollipop: 9/10 absolutely yummy, melts in you
- Tanjore Lamb Chop Masala: 9/10 yummy as well, comes with a lot of masala that can be paired with naan or rice
- Garlic Naan: 10/10 soft, fresh, perfect amount of garlic, delicious!
- Tiger Shrimp Biryani: 9/10 on the spicier side, came out fresh and soft
- Double Ka Meeta: 6/10 alright, but not my favorite bread pudding",11-Apr-24,"St. Louis, MO",Erica S.,5
